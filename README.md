## Updated heating control based on libgpiod 
since the current SD card died on my RPi that controls my heating it's time for an update. The former code worked unexpectadely great for years so why change? The code was built up on wiringpi which was at the time of coding already marked as depriciated, years later it is finally taken out of the distro i use.   
In the search of an alternative i hit on libgpiod that seems to the current date to be maintained.
